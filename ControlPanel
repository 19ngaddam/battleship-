Once the guessing begins, the players may not move the ships. \n The 5 ships are:  Carrier (occupies 6 spaces), Battleship (5), Cruiser (4), Submarine (3), and Destroyer (2).   \n Player's take turns guessing by calling out the coordinates. The opponent responds with hit or miss as appropriate. \n Both players should mark their board with pegs:  red for hit, white for miss. \n For example, if you call out F6 and your opponent does not have any ship located at F6, your opponent would respond with miss. \n You record the miss F6 by placing a white peg on the lower part of your board at F6.  Your opponent records the miss by placing. \n When all of the squares that one your ships occupies have been hit, the ship will be sunk.  \n As soon as all of one player's ships have been sunk, the game ends.";
